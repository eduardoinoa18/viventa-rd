## üîç How to Verify Your Data

### Step 1: Access Admin Diagnostics
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/diagnostics` (or your deployed URL)
2. Login as master admin
3. View the "Firestore Collections" section
4. You should see:
   - **users**: Shows how many user documents exist
   - **properties**: Shows created listings
   - **Sample data** for each collection with IDs and basic info

### Step 2: Check User Account
1. Go to `/admin/users`
2. Use the role filter dropdown to select "User" or "Agent"
3. Your created account should appear here
4. Check the **Status** column - should show `active`, `pending`, or `suspended`
5. Check the **Role** column - shows the user type

### Step 3: Verify Listing Creation Flow
1. Login as agent
2. Go to `/agent/listings/create`
3. Fill out the form:
   - Upload at least 1 image (required)
   - Fill title and description
   - Set price, bedrooms, bathrooms
   - Select property and listing type
4. Click submit
5. You should be redirected to `/listing/[id]`
6. The property should now appear in:
   - `/admin/properties` (admin can approve it)
   - `/search` (if status is `active`)
   - Homepage featured section (if `featured=true` and `status=active`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No users found" in Admin Users Page
**Cause**: User document created with wrong structure or in different collection
**Solution**:
1. Check `/admin/diagnostics` to see if users exist
2. Verify the user was created during signup (check Firebase Console)
3. User document should have:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "role": "user" | "agent" | "broker" | "admin" | "master_admin",
  "status": "active" | "pending" | "suspended",
  "createdAt": Timestamp,
  "updatedAt": Timestamp
}
```

### Issue: "Firebase not configured" error
**Cause**: Environment variables missing
**Solution**: Verify all these are in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBbfVSutdfIEQGRIQm7CvsahpXRF4R1uTk
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=viventa-2a3fb.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=viventa-2a3fb
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=viventa-2a3fb.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=947338447559
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:947338447559:web:c4976c91825adba104cce2
```

### Issue: Created listings don't appear on homepage
**Cause**: Property status or featured flag not set correctly
**Solution**:
1. Check property status in Firebase - must be `active`
2. For homepage featured section - must have `featured: true` AND `status: 'active'`
3. FeaturedProperties component queries:
```javascript
where('status', '==', 'active'),
where('featured', '==', true)
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors during build
**Cause**: Firestore rules restrict unauthenticated access (this is correct!)
**Solution**: This is expected and non-blocking. Pages work perfectly at runtime when users are authenticated.

## üéØ Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Test User Creation Flow
```bash
# Test Signup ‚Üí Database entry
1. Go to /signup
2. Create account as agent
3. Complete onboarding
4. Verify user appears in /admin/users
5. Check role is set to "agent"
```

### 2. Test Listing Creation ‚Üí Homepage Display

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] 1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] 2. Navigate to `/admin/diagnostics` to verify Firebase connection
- [ ] 3. Check which collections have data
- [ ] 4. If users collection is empty, create a test account via `/signup`
- [ ] 5. Verify user appears in `/admin/users`
- [ ] 6. Change user role to "agent" if needed
- [ ] 7. Login as agent and create test listing
- [ ] 8. Verify listing appears in `/admin/properties`
- [ ] 9. Approve listing to make it `active`
- [ ] 10. Verify listing shows on `/search` and homepage (if featured)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Diagnostics First**: Always check `/admin/diagnostics` before troubleshooting
2. **Role Assignment**: New signups default to `role: "user"` - admins must manually change to "agent"
3. **Featured Listings**: Only listings with `featured: true` AND `status: "active"` show on homepage
4. **Image Upload**: Images go to Firebase Storage at `properties/{agentId}/{filename}`
5. **Status Flow**: `draft` ‚Üí `pending` ‚Üí `active` or `rejected`

## üìû Need Help?

The system IS working and connected. If you're not seeing data:
1. Check `/admin/diagnostics` - is Firebase connected? Do collections exist?
2. Check Firebase Console directly - are documents there?
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify you're logged in with correct role (`master_admin` or `admin`)
5. Check middleware.ts isn't redirecting you

All backend APIs are fully functional and connected to real Firebase data. The diagnostics page will help you identify exactly where data exists and where it doesn't.
