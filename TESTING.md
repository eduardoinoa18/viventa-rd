# Testing Guide - VIVENTA Platform

## Overview
This document covers the testing approach for VIVENTA, including E2E tests with Playwright and manual QA procedures.

## Playwright E2E Tests

### Setup
Install Playwright and browser drivers:
```powershell
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests (headless)
npm run test:e2e

# Run with browser UI visible
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/apply.spec.ts

# Debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Test Coverage

#### Apply Flow (`tests/apply.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Happy path: Submit without resume (agent)
- ✅ Validation error: Missing required fields shows toast
- ✅ Failure path: Error handling and button re-enable

### E2E Mock Mode
Tests run with `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E=1` and access `/apply?e2e=1` to enable mock mode:
- **Success path**: Skips Firebase uploads/writes, shows success screen after 300ms
- **Failure path**: Add `?e2e=1&fail=1` to simulate error

This allows fast, reliable tests without Firebase dependencies.

### Configuration
See `playwright.config.ts` for:
- Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile device emulation (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- Video/screenshot capture on failure
- Auto-start dev server with E2E mode

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)
Add `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`:
```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run test:e2e
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Vercel Preview Deployments
Run E2E tests against preview URLs:
```powershell
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL="https://your-preview-url.vercel.app"
npm run test:e2e
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

### View test reports
```powershell
npx playwright show-report
```

### Run single test in debug mode
```powershell
npx playwright test tests/apply.spec.ts --debug
```

### View trace files
```powershell
npx playwright show-trace playwright-traces/trace.zip
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in `tests/` directory
2. Import Playwright test utilities:
   ```typescript
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
   ```
3. Write test scenarios with clear descriptions
4. Use page object pattern for complex flows
5. Run locally before committing

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Firebase Storage CORS in tests
**Workaround**: Use E2E mock mode (`?e2e=1`) to skip uploads

### Issue: Algolia rate limits in CI
**Workaround**: Use test index with higher limits or mock Algolia responses
