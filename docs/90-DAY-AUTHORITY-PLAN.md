# 90-Day Authority Execution Plan
**VIVENTA — Dominican Republic Verified Marketplace**  
**Start Date:** February 24, 2026  
**North Star:** Become the #1 verified & professional real estate marketplace in DR  
**Success Metric:** Recognition as the trusted platform (not just "another listing site")

---

## Strategic Foundation

### Current State
✅ Enterprise-grade technical platform (75 API routes, 92 components, full CRUD)  
✅ Multi-role authentication (master admin, agents, brokers, users)  
✅ Custom search engine (zero external costs)  
✅ Production-ready infrastructure (Vercel + Firebase)  

❌ Generic market positioning ("just another property site")  
❌ No trust differentiation (looks like competitors)  
❌ Under-monetized (Stripe ready but not activated)  
❌ Missing emotional/visual authority  

### Strategic Positioning

**From:**  
> "A property listing platform for the Dominican Republic"

**To:**  
> "La plataforma inmobiliaria verificada de República Dominicana — donde agentes profesionales y propiedades confirmadas se encuentran con confianza total."

**Differentiation:**
- **vs. Facebook Groups:** Professional, verified, organized (not chaotic)
- **vs. Corotos:** Trust-first, real agents, quality control (not informal spam)
- **vs. International Platforms:** DR-focused, local expertise, peso pricing (not generic global)

**Unfair Advantage:**  
Eduardo's credibility: Licensed realtor + tax specialist + DR investment expert

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Agents don't apply for verification  
**Mitigation:** Manual outreach to top 20 agents in each city; offer "Founding Member" status

**Risk:** Slow content creation for SEO pages  
**Mitigation:** Auto-generate city/neighborhood content from listing data + basic templates

**Risk:** Low engagement with email digests  
**Mitigation:** A/B test subject lines, send times, and formats; focus on value (price drops, new listings)

**Risk:** Technical debt slows feature velocity  
**Mitigation:** Prioritize ruthlessly; cut scope on non-critical polish; ship MVP versions fast

---

## Resources Required

**Development:**
- 20 hours/week coding (Copilot Agent + Eduardo review)
- Focus: UI polish, verification workflows, SEO pages
- Tools: Existing stack (Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind)

**Content:**

- Eduardo's expertise = unfair advantage here

**Admin/Ops:**
