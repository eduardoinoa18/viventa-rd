# 48-Hour Authority Window — ACTIVE

**Status:** 🟢 IN PROGRESS  
**Start Time:** February 17, 2026 - 10:15 PM EST  
**End Time:** February 19, 2026 - 10:15 PM EST  
**Mode:** Real Operations  
**Fallback:** `/admin` only if critical failure  

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Validate **dominance**, not functionality.

From this moment forward, `/master` is headquarters.

---

## 📜 RULES

1. **No casual switching to `/admin`**
   - Only if something truly blocks operations

2. **No refactoring mid-test**
   - Even if something annoys you

3. **Log friction — don't fix friction**

4. **Operate normally**
   - Approve real listings
   - Edit real properties  
   - Make real decisions

---

## 🧠 WHAT WE'RE MEASURING

- **Confidence:** Do you trust Master to handle critical operations?
- **Authority:** Does it feel like a command center?
- **Flow:** Are context switches minimal?
- **Mental Load:** Is it cognitively lighter than Admin?
- **Perceived Power:** Do actions feel decisive?

---

- F: Rollback - return to `/admin`, reassess architecture

**Notes:**

This is not QA.
This is psychological validation.

The question isn't "Does it work?"

The question is:

"Does it command?"
